## Lessons Learned 💭
Implementing a dark mode feature was a new challenge. Instead of adding a specific color to each element, I would create specific color functions for dark/light, and apply them to the elements.

## Optimization ✅
When I improve the project, I would begin with using a framework to increase efficiency with CSS such as Tailwind. I would love to add easter egg animations throughout the page such as my profile image or name on the top left. In addition, I would use more semantic tags instead of div.
